# Rule Performance Analytics and Visualization in Power-BI
Rule Performance Analysis with Power BI
Project Overview
This project leverages Power BI, Python, and Amazon Redshift to provide advanced data visualization and analysis of rule performance. It offers valuable insights through various analytical features and interactive dashboards.

Features
Usage Count Analysis
Description: Visualizes the distribution and frequency of rule usage.
Benefit: Helps understand patterns in the application of rules, identifying which rules are most and least frequently used.
Unimodel Library Table
Description: Provides detailed statistics including minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation for 'AM0' and 'AM1' occurrences.
Benefit: Facilitates comprehensive analysis of rule effectiveness and variability.
Rulebook Codes Table
Description: Lists rule names along with their corresponding rulebook codes.
Benefit: Enhances communication and understanding by enabling quick referencing of rulebook codes.
Z-Score Analysis
Description: Identifies trends and outliers in rule performance over different timeframes (last day, week, month) using clustered column charts.
Benefit: Highlights significant deviations in rule performance, aiding in trend analysis and outlier detection.
Detailed View with Slicer
Description: Allows for targeted exploration of specific rules, displaying z-scores with color-coded highlights for significant deviations.
Benefit: Supports informed decision-making and strategy refinement by providing detailed insights into specific rules.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Power BI Desktop
Amazon Redshift
Required Python packages: pandas, sqlalchemy, boto3, psycopg2, numpy, scikit-learn
Data source files (CSV, Excel, etc.)
Steps
1. Set Up Amazon Redshift
Create a Redshift cluster and database.
Configure security groups to allow connections from your IP address.
Create tables and load your data into Redshift.
2. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
3. Install Python Packages

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure Database Connection
Update the database connection settings in your Python scripts to connect to your Amazon Redshift cluster.
5. Run Data Collection and Processing Scripts
Use Python scripts to collect, process, and load data into Redshift.

python data_collection_script.py
python data_processing_script.py
6. Open Power BI Desktop
Install Power BI Desktop if you haven't already. You can download it from the official Power BI website.
7. Load Data from Redshift into Power BI
Open the Power BI file (.pbix) in the repository.
Connect to your Amazon Redshift database from Power BI Desktop.
Load the processed data into Power BI.
8. Refresh Data
Once the data is loaded, refresh the data to ensure the latest information is displayed on the dashboards.
Usage
Interactive Dashboards: Navigate through the different tabs in Power BI to explore various analyses and visualizations.
Slicers and Filters: Use the slicers and filters provided in the dashboards to focus on specific rules, timeframes, or data subsets.
Exporting Reports: Export visualizations and reports as needed for presentations or further analysis.
